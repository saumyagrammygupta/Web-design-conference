                      Web design and development are the hottest fields of technology and with new tools and products being developed almost every day, one needs to stay updated in every aspect. You need to learn about the new programmes, upcoming developments in the field and stay connected with your fellow designers and developers.
                      And if there’s one place where you can find opportunities for further learning, networking and a glimpse into future research all under one roof, that’s a web design conference.</p>
                  <p>
                      Co-founded and now run by John Allsopp, Web Directions has for over a decade brought together leading developers, engineers, visual, IxD, UX and product designers, Art and Creative Directors, indeed everyone involved in producing web and digital products to learn from one another, and the World's leading experts across this vast field.
                      We spend our lives thinking about what comes next, keeping up with trends in technology, practices and processes, and filtering the hype, to make sure you don't miss trends that matter, and don't waste time on hype that doesn't.
                      We promise attending one of our events will leave you significantly better versed in the challenges you face day to day, and in solutions for addressing them.
                      In 2019, we'll be organising Design, Design Leaders, Code and Code Leaders and Product in Melbourne, and Web Directions Summit, and Culture in Sydney
