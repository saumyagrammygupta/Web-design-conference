            Web design and development are the hottest fields of technology and with new tools and products
            being
            developed almost every day, one needs to stay updated in every aspect. You need to learn about
            the new
            programmes, upcoming developments in the field and stay connected with your fellow designers and
            developers.
            And if there’s one place where you can find opportunities for further learning, networking and a
            glimpse
            into future research all under one roof, that’s a web design conference.
            <br></br>
            Co-founded and now run by John Allsopp, Web Directions has for over a decade brought together
            leading
            developers, engineers, visual, IxD, UX and product designers, Art and Creative Directors, indeed
            everyone involved in producing web and digital products to learn from one another, and the
            World's
            leading experts across this vast field.
            We spend our lives thinking about what comes next, keeping up with trends in technology,
            practices and
            processes, and filtering the hype, to make sure you don't miss trends that matter, and don't
            waste time
            on hype that doesn't.
            We promise attending one of our events will leave you significantly better versed in the
            challenges you
            face day to day, and in solutions for addressing them.
            In 2019, we'll be organising Design, Design Leaders, Code and Code Leaders and Product in
            Melbourne, and
            Web Directions Summit, and Culture in Sydney
